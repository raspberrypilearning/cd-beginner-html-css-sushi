## Download your project!

- Lets download your code and look at it! At the top left corner of the code panel, click on the menu icon that looks like three lines, and click Download.

- A zip file will be downloaded. It contains all the files for your website. 

- Open up the zip file and find the file called index.html. Remember this file is your homepage. Double click on it to open it up in a **browser**. Click the links and explore your website in all its glory!

- Can you see the page title at the top of the tab or window? Notice the title on each page. This is the text you put in between the `<title> </title>` tags.

- Leave the browser window open, and go back to the window with the list of files. Find index.html again. This time right click it \(to "right click" on a Mac, either click and hold, or click with two fingers!\), select "Open With &gt;" and choose a plain text editor such as Notepad, Notepad++ or Sublime Text. You should see all the HTML tags, like in the code panel on Trinket.

  If you are using a Mac, you may need to install a plain text editor first

- As you know, a web page is just made up of text, with tags to control it. Now you can see that the web page and the code are in fact the same file: depending on whether you open it in a **browser** or a **plain text editor**, you will see either the **code** \(text and tags\) or the **web page** \(just text\).

- Congratulations! Why not share your project with other people to show it off? Click the Share button (next to the Save button) and select one of the options.
