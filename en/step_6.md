## Adding a map or video

YouTube provides an easy way to add its videos to your website. Adding elements from other online sources to your website is also called **embedding**.

- Find a video on YouTube that you want to show on your website. 

- Click on the **Share** button below the video. Select the option **Embed**.

You will see a text box with all the text selected. If you accidentally unselect the text, you can select it all again by clicking on it and pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd> on a Mac) and <kbd>A</kbd> keys at the same time.

- Press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd> on a Mac) and <kbd>C</kbd> keys together to copy the text.

- Then go back to your website's HTML code, and click in the place where you want to put the video, for example below a heading or paragraph. **Paste** the code by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd> on a Mac) and <kbd>V</kbd> on your keyboard at the same time. Don't worry about understanding all the code you just pasted!

You should see the video appear on your webpage.

The same technique works for Google maps as well. Give it a go!

- Go [here](http://dojo.soy/google-maps) and search for a place you want to show on your website. **Note:** do **not** share personal information such as your home address on a website!

- Click on the result, then click the **Share** button, and copy the code and add it to your website as above.

- If you look carefully, you should find `width` and `height` **attributes** in the pasted code. You can change their values to make the map appear bigger or smaller.
