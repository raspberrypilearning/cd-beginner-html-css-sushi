## Adding a map or video

YouTube provides an easy way to **embed** \(or put\) videos from it onto your website. 

- Find a video on YouTube that you want to show on your website. 

- Look for the "Share" button and click it. Select the option "Embed".

You will see a text box with all the text selected \(if you accidentally unselect the text, you can select it all again by clicking on it and pressing the **Ctrl** \(or **cmd** on a Mac\) and **A** keys together on your keyboard\).

- Press the **Ctrl** \(or **cmd**\) and **C** keys together on your keyboard to **copy** the text.

- Then go back to your website code, and click in the place where you want to put the video, for example after a heading or paragraph. **Paste** the code by pressing **Ctrl** \(or **cmd**\) and **V** on your keyboard at the same time. Don't worry about understanding all the code you just pasted!

You should see the video appear on your web page.

The same technique works for Google maps as well. 

- Give it a go! Go to [dojo.soy/google-maps](http://dojo.soy/google-maps) and search for a place you want to show on your website. **Note:** It's **not** a good idea to share personal information such as your home address on a website!

- Click on the result, then find the Share button and get the code and add it to your website as above.

- If you look carefully you should be able to find `width` and `height` **attributes** in the pasted code. You can change the values to make the map appear bigger or smaller.
