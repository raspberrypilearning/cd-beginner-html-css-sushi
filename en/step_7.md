- So you've decided what pages you'd like to have in your website, now let's make them! To create a new web page, you create a new file with a name that ends in **.html**. At the top of the code panel, click on the **+** symbol next to the tabs. This will create a new file. Give it a name. Remember, it must end in **.html** \(including the dot!\) so that the browser knows it's a web page.

If you want to change the name of a file, click on the cog icon to the right of the filename, and click the pencil. Type in the new name and press Enter. You can also delete a file by clicking the bin icon instead of the pencil.

- You might be wondering why you can't change the name of the index.html file. "index.html" is a special name used for the **homepage** of a website. That's the first page you land on when you visit a website. When you go to a website's homepage, the browser looks for the file called "index.html" and displays it on your screen.

- Go the the file blank\_page.html in the code panel \(by clicking on the tab with that name\). Select all of the text in the file by doing the following: Click anywhere inside the code panel, then press and hold the **Ctrl** key \(or if you are using a Mac, the **cmd** key\) and while holding it, press the **A** key at the same time. Notice how all the text becomes highlighted.

- Now, with the text selected, press and hold the **Ctrl** \(or **cmd**\) key again and then while holding it press the **C** key. This **copies** everything that was selected.

- Go to your new file and click inside the code panel \(which is blank at the moment\). Press and hold the **Ctrl** \(or **cmd**\) key and then while holding it, press the **V** key. This **pastes** everything that was copied into your new page.

  You can use these keyboard shortcuts in most programs to **copy** and **paste** stuff, including text and files!

- Change the text in between the `<title> </title>` tags so your new page has a descriptive title.

- In between the `<main> </main>` tags in the new file, use the tags you have learned to add stuff to the page, such as paragraphs, headings, images and lists!

- Repeat the steps above for each new page that you want to add. 

- When there are too many tabs to be able to see them all, you can use the **<** and **>** icons in the top left corner of the tabs to scroll between them.
