## Adding a map or vide

- Bonus: add a video! YouTube provides an easy way to **embed** \(put\) videos from it onto your website. Find a video on YouTube that you want to show on your website. 

- Look for the "Share" button and click it. Select the option "Embed".

- You will see a text box with all the text selected \(if you accidentally unselect the text, you can select it all again by clicking on it and pressing the **Ctrl** \(or **cmd**\) and **A** keys together on your keyboard, just like before\). Press the **Ctrl** \(or **cmd**\) and **C** keys together on your keyboard to **copy** the text.

- Then go to your code, and click in the place where you want to put the video, for example after a heading or paragraph. Paste the code by pressing **Ctrl** \(or **cmd**\) and **V** on your keyboard at the same time, as usual. Don't worry about understanding all the code you just pasted!

- Click Run to see the video appear on your web page.

- The same technique works for Google maps as well. Give it a go! Go to [dojo.soy/google-maps](http://dojo.soy/google-maps) and search for a place you want to show on your website. Click on the result, then find the Share button and get the code and add it to your website as above.

- If you look carefully you should be able to find `width` and `height` attributes in the pasted code. You can change the values to make the map appear bigger or smaller.
